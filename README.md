# Public Organisation Profile Documentation

This repo contains the required files to create a landing page for a public user who opens the organisation, according to Github specifications. Thus, any major changes to the file structure and naming might break the final landing page, and any such changes should be checked against the Github specifications.

The page being displayed is generated from `/profile/README.md`.
